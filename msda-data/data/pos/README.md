The POS tagging data comes from [SANCL 2012 shared task on Parsing the web](https://sites.google.com/site/sancl2012/home/shared-task), which contains 5 web domains (Emails, Weblogs, Answers, Newsgroups, and Reviews) annotated with universal postags.

We use an additional Twitter dataset from the [Twitter universal treebank] (https://github.com/Oneplus/Tweebank) to simulate negative transfer.
